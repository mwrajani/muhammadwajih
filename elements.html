										A Programmer's Journey in Mobile App Development by empowering the visually impaired with a seamless coffee ordering experience through innovation and inclusivity.</p>

								<p>Reflecting on an extraordinary journey at Windesheim in Zwolle, our team embarked on a mission to revolutionize the coffee ordering experience for visually impaired individuals. Led by a shared passion for inclusivity and innovation, we collaborated closely with MAAS International BV to develop a groundbreaking mobile application.</p>
								<p>Our journey began with the inception of the project, where we meticulously crafted the initial business case and conceptualized the solution. Drawing upon our expertise in React Native, we embarked on the development phase, leveraging the power of this framework to build a robust and scalable application architecture.</p>
							    <p>As a programmer, my role extended beyond mere coding; I delved into the intricacies of user experience design, utilizing Adobe XD to craft intuitive and accessible interfaces. With a keen eye for detail, I ensured that every element of the app—from the placement of buttons to the color contrast—was optimized for seamless navigation and usability.</p>
								<p>One of the most rewarding aspects of this project was achieving compliance with the 2025 European Union laws. Working in tandem with our legal team, I meticulously documented every aspect of the application, ensuring that it adhered to the highest standards of accessibility and compliance.</p>
								<p>Throughout the development process, we encountered numerous challenges, each serving as an opportunity for growth and innovation. Whether it was optimizing performance for different processor architectures like aarch64 and x86 or refining the user interface to enhance user experience, we approached each challenge with tenacity and creativity.</p>
								<p>Our collaborative efforts were further amplified by the invaluable support and guidance provided by Marijn Oudijk at MAAS International BV, as well as the Windesheim University’s exchange program. We are deeply grateful for the opportunity to work alongside Professor Swen-Peter Ekkebus, whose mentorship and expertise were instrumental in shaping our project's success.</p>
								<p>At the heart of our journey were the talented individuals who comprised our team: Jennifer Svensson, Glenn Nijenhuis, Céline Paulin, and Asim Naveed Bhatti. Together, we not only refined our technical skills but also championed inclusivity in design, culminating in the honor of receiving the prestigious Inclusion Award at Windesheim’s Winnovation Expo.</p>
								<p>As we bid farewell to Zwolle and embark on new adventures, we carry with us the invaluable lessons and experiences gained from this transformative project. With gratitude in our hearts and determination in our spirits, we look forward to leveraging these insights in our future endeavors, continuing to drive innovation and inclusivity in technology.</p>
